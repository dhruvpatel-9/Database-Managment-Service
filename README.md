# WOLFMEDIA STREAMING SERVICE

This project involves designing and building a database management system for WolfMedia, an audio and media streaming service similar to Spotify and Apple Music. The system will be used by administrators and management to maintain information on songs, artists, record labels, albums, podcasts, and podcast hosts. Additionally, the system will track monthly listeners, total subscribers, and payments made to artists, record labels, and podcast hosts.

The system will enable operations such as information processing, metadata and record maintenance, payment tracking, and generating reports. Information processing involves entering, updating, and deleting basic information about songs, artists, podcast hosts, and podcast episodes. Maintaining metadata and records includes updating play count for songs, monthly listeners for artists, subscriber count and ratings for podcasts, and listening count for podcast episodes. Payment tracking involves making royalty payments for songs and paying podcast hosts. Reports will be generated to provide information on monthly play counts, revenue, payments made to artists, record labels, and podcast hosts, and a list of songs and podcast episodes associated with specific artists, albums, and podcasts.

This project will involve making assumptions and resolving potential inconsistencies while deciding what information to include in the database. The system will be designed to manage payments made to artists, record labels, and podcast hosts based on a royalty rate and total play count. Monthly payments to subscribers will also be tracked.
